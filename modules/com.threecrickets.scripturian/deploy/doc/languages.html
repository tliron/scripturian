		<h2>Supported Languages</h2>

		<h3>Python</h3>
		<p>
			Two implementations exist for Python on the JVM: <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> and <a href="http://jepp.sourceforge.net/">Jepp</a>.
			The former is 100% Java, while the latter uses a Java bridge to a natively compiled CPython of your choice, and is generally more complicated to install
			and performs poorly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jython 2.5.2 is supported via its JSR-223 interface, with some fixes for odd behavior.
			Compilation to byetcode is supported, though it is currently cached to memory and thus executables are re-compiled every time
			the JVM is restarted.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Though 2.5.2 is not yet available at the time of this writing, you can
			get a recent snapshot.
			Unfortunately, Jython 2.5.1 could not support Scripturian's threading model over JSR-223. We are grateful to the Jython team for accepting
			our suggestion on how to fix it!
		</p>
		<p>
			Jepp is supported via its JSR-223 interface. It does not support invocation of entry points.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Ruby</h3>
		<p>
			Ruby is implemented by <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a> over our custom interface.
			Version 1.4 is supported.
			Compilation to byetcode is supported, though it is currently cached to memory and thus executables are re-compiled every time
			the JVM is restarted.
		</p>
		<p>
			JRuby comes with JSR-223 support, and configurable threading models. However, after considerable experimentation, we found all of them incompatible
			with Scripturian's requirements, and so devised our own adapter. Ours is based on creating separate JRuby
			runtimes per execution context, with a trick to allow changing the standard output and standard error and thus reusing the runtime.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			You will need a snapshot of JRuby 1.5 if you wish to combine JRuby and Jython on the same VM.
			We are grateful to the JRuby team for accommodating our request to allow this, and cooperating
			with the Jython team to make it happen!
		</p>
		
		<h3>Groovy</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> is designed for the JVM and works quite transparently via its built-in JSR-223 interface.
		</p>

		<h3>Clojure</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is designed for the JVM and implemented via our custom interface. Our implementation involves
			creating lightweight namespaces on-the-fly for each execution context. Clojure compilation to JVM bytecode is not supported, but
	 		it remains an open question, too, whether this would significantly
	 		improve performance. Clojure's highly dynamic nature would make compiled
	 		code quite uninteresting. It's likely that the JVM's optimization would
	 		work just as well on "interpreted" Clojure.
		</p>
		<p>
			A <a href="http://code.google.com/p/clojure-jsr223/">JSR-223 interface</a> exists, but we found it unusable for Scripturian's
			concurrency requirements.
		</p>

		<h3>PHP</h3>
		<p>
			PHP5 is implemented by Caucho's <a href="http://quercus.caucho.com/">Quercus</a>. Note that Quercus license is GPL, which puts limitations
			on your ability to distribute it with your product.
		</p>
		<p>
			Scripturian support is over Quercus' included JSR-223 interface. It does not support invocation of entry points.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Note that Scripturian
			replaces PHP's scriptlet scheme with its own. Usage and performance should be identical, but Scripturian's scheme is more powerful than PHP's,
			because it allows for mixing languages in one file.
		</p>

		<h3>JavaScript</h3>
		<p>
			Your distribution of Java may already have JavaScript support built in, in which case you're already good to go.
			This is true for Sun's JDK and OpenJDK. Otherwise, JavaScript is implemented by Mozilla's <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a>.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			Note that Sun and OpenJDK's built-in JavaScript support is a simplified version of Rhino, which may limit the power of Scripturian, so that
			Mozilla's version is recommended. If you have both versions installed, use the "rhino-nonjdk" name to circumvent the built-in Rhino
			(see demo JavaScript source code).
		</p>
		<p>
			Mozilla's Rhino requires a small library for
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/">Java scripting standard (JSR-223)</a>, which is available 
			at the <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">Java scripting project</a>. (This was true for version 1.7R1.)
			See the <a href="requirements.html">requirement notes</a> if you are using Java 5.

		<h3>Succinct</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://threecrickets.com/succinct/">Succinct</a> is currently the only language with built-in Scripturian support! 
		</p>

		<h3>Velocity</h3>
		<p>
			Get Velocity <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/">here</a>. Note that you also need a small library for
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/">Java scripting standard (JSR-223)</a>, which is available 
			at the <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">Java scripting project</a>.
