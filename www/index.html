See the <a href="http://threecrickets.com/scripturian/">main site</a>  for more information and full documentation.</p><p>Releases are available for download <a href="http://scripturian.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=10328">here</a>. <br /></p><h3>Features</h3>   <p>Scripturian's central feature is that is provides embedded scripting support for many scripting languages, allowing you to mix plain text and embedded &quot;scriptlets,&quot; in the style of PHP, JSP and ASP. Any application that generates text can make good use of it, at the minimum as a templating solution, but at the maximum as a development platform for complete applications. For example, a blogging or content management application can use it to give users complete control over theming/skinning, while a data server can use it to create a web user interface.<br /></p>       <p>It's not always easy to configure and start arbitrary scripting engines, contexts, etc. Scripturian does it all for you. For example, any file with <span style="font-family: monospace">&lt;%python</span> at the beginning will start the appropriate script engine. It's a straightforward equivalent of the <span style="font-family: monospace">#!/</span> used by shells.</p>       <p>Finally, it provides an easy way to bootstrap Java applications using scripting, by delegating the <span style="font-family: monospace">main()</span> method straight into an embedded script. It makes it easy to quickly make changes in how your applications start up without recompiling it.</p>    <h3>Supported Scripting Languages</h3>    <ul>    <li>JavaScript</li>       <li>PHP<br />    </li>       <li>Python</li>       <li>Ruby</li>       <li>Groovy</li><li>Velocity <br />    </li>    </ul>    <h3>Uses</h3>Scripturian is a key component of <a href="http://www.threecrickets.com/restoration/">Restoration</a> .<br /><h3>About This Site</h3> <p>This is Scripturian's support and development site, generously hosted by Tigris.</p>  <ul><li>For support, search the <a href="http://scripturian.tigris.org/ds/viewForums.do">forums (called &quot;discussions&quot; on Tigris)</a>  for answers to your questions, or join them and post your new question.<br /></li><li>Help make Scripturian better by <a href="http://scripturian.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">reporting bugs (&quot;defects&quot;)</a> <a href="http://scripturian.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">  or requesting enhancements</a>.</li><li>Better yet, contribute patches and code yourself.
